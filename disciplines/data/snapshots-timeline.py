We can always say if statement is true on some kind of data. For example:
In 2002 AMM was member ALS.
AMM is member of ALS.

Tom Kuhn wrote The structure of scientific revolutions'
did('Tom Kuhn', 'wrote', 'The structure of scientific revolutions')
did_wrote('Tom Kuhn', 'wrote', 'The structure of scientific revolutions')
