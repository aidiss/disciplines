"""Machine learning

Machine learning module is dedicated to use ML methods to study disciplines
and related phenomenon.
One simple example of using machine modules is taking a list of 
of set of disciplines and, based of knowledge, doing some arrangaments.

This can be used to council-based classifications, hard - soft, pure - 
applied, life - non life.

It is also possible to cattegorize people, learned_societies and etc.
