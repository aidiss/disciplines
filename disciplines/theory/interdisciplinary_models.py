    Theory:
        • The complementarity model: linking up of complementary skills to form a joint
        approach to an issue. Rather than just simply juxtaposing disciplinary contributions, the
        different points at which knowledge is linked up are explored with the aim of making a
        joint achievement (analysis, problem- solving, use of an experimental instrument). One of
        the disciplines sometimes plays a leading role, with the risk of instrumenting the others.
        Disciplinary cleavages are reproduced without displacing the researcher’s identity.
        Sometimes, the protagonists become aware of the limits of their discipline and hence
        query the divisions and feel the need to revise their conceptual approaches.

def is_model_circulation(dsc):
    """
    Theory:
        • The circulation model: researchers belonging to one discipline explore others in
        order to borrow their concepts, methods, questions or problems to be solved. Lavoisier
        thus imported tools and methods from experimental physics for the purposes of
        chemistry; the École des Annales (French school of annals), did the same for history, by
        opening up to economics, sociology and then anthropology. The receiving discipline is
        itself sometimes structured around several specialities according to the imports made.
        Pre- history provides an excellent example of this as it draws its resources from anatomy,
        technology, ecology, genetics, ethology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, chemistry
        and physics (dating techniques), climatology, botany and zoology.

        Theory: 
            The fusion model: grouping together of researchers working on the same object,
            attenuating the distinctions between the initial disciplines. Ecology is an example of a
            speciality born from the merging of several types of knowledge around an object and
            concepts such as niche and ecosystem. It brings together knowledge from botany,
            zoology, pedology and orography. The new speciality reconfi gures the identity of
            researchers around a new reference. In other cases, this reconfi guration only leads to a
            vague assembly that fails to be recognised from an institutional point of view.
