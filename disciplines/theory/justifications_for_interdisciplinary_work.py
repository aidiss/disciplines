    borders : what are borders of discipline?
    border change : how borders are changing. Can be based on snapshots
    concern : is concern 'benefit of society'
    benefit of society : what words are used for that?
    partitions between sciences : where are those? how are they related to borders?

    Args:

    Returns:

    Theory:
        Scientific creativity: the results of this are all the more fruitful when unexpected
        parallels occur. Many discoveries stem from the fact that researchers work outside of
        their speciality: Lavoisier handled explosives but was also a tax farmer (accountant and
        tax collector); Pasteur was a chemist; Einstein was an engineer working in a technological
        invention offi ce. The greatest scholars were heroes, brave enough to question the
        established knowledge passed on via routine education. Theoretical innovation seems to
        occur at the interstices and not at the core of introspective disciplines. Paradoxically, in
        places with the highest density of researchers, there is a smaller probability of innovation
        per capita. The creation of new disciplines is linked to the impossibility of following a
        career in established and prestigious disciplines. Morever, there is a greater transfer of
        ideas when researchers work at their discipline boundaries and cross over, if only slightly,
        into other disciplines (Granovetter, 1973).  
        Examples:
            Einstein
            Lavoisier

        • Conquest: knowledge is a constantly expanding empire. Progress occurs at the outskirts of
        this empire. It is a question of clearing new land, discovering new continents and exploring the 
        frontiers of knowledge. These frontiers are similar to the boundaries of disciplines where 
        researchers are encouraged to work.

    Returns:

    Theory:
        Relevance of scientific work in relation to the object or issue at stake: when
        addressing certain problems, fragmented scientific approaches would appear to bear little
        fruit. In a socioeconomic context where the concern is to use research for the benefit
        of society, voices can be heard campaigning in favour of interdisciplinary approaches in
        order to step over the partitions between sciences.

    Returns:

    Theory:
        when the focus of research is an instrument, an object or a land, it is sometimes necessary to 
        mobilise the resources of several disciplines. In anthropology, for example, researchers doing 
        fieldwork have to get around the problem of the language barrier; they have to decode the way 
        the people being studied talk about the world and classify its constituent parts; they have to 
        nderstand the codes of perception and translate these into their observer’s coding system. When 
        Da Matta (1992) tried to make a note of a few indigenous words (gaioes Indians in Brazil), he 
        had to solve problems relating to phonetics. Later, as he was working on a population census and
        attempting to locate a village on a map, he learnt the basics of geography, topography and 
        scale drawing, and then discovered botanical, topographical and zoological classifications,
        religion, law, psychology, politics and even medicine. Different disciplinary resources are 
        needed for better understanding in fieldwork.
        Examples:
            anthropology

    Surprise:
        Very nice! I like Di mata! His story is similar!
