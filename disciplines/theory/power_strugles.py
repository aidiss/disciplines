    Are wars happening because of conquest?

    Theory:
        Wars of conquest and hegemony where, each in turn, theology, physics, molecular 
        biology, sociology,1 economics, sociobiology,2 neurosciences,3 and so on, believe 
        they can rule over all or part of the fields of knowledge, either by setting up a 
        skilful division of labour, or by making sure they are well placed in the tree of 
        knowledge, or by imposing the right scientific method on all the others. The 
        temptation at times is to isolate a metatheory (as a systemic theory) or an 
        interdisciplinary science in a quest for a new unity of all sciences, even 
        including religions too.
    
    Examples:
        theology, 
        physics, 
        molecular biology, 
        sociology, # Original note: Comte saw sociology as the chosen science for enlightening the world and indicating the
way forward. In the 1970s, relativist sociology of the sciences in Great Britain reduced 
the claims of physics to simple social constructions that could only be explained through
sociological analysis.
        economics, 
        sociobiology, # Original note: Sociobiology attempted to explain behaviour, society- related facts, culture, politics and
morals using strictly biological bases.
        neurosciences # Original note: With the concept of ‘neuronal man’, neurophysiology claimed that it had founded and
unifi ed psychology, psychoanalysis and aesthetics.

        a state of collapse at the end of the 1960s because the scientific managers of the French
        CNRS redeployed their resources to molecular biology, hence placing other disciplines
        below the survival threshold.
