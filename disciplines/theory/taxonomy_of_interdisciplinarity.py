    among a “jigsaw puzzle-like composition” of adjacent fields. He also noted the Apollo space
    project (in Interdisciplinarity 1972, p.88). In Composite ID, the AFIR team found, production of
    knowledge retains a strong disciplinary thrust. However, results are integrated within a common
    framework. In the biosciences, for instance, technical knowledge from many fields and
    expensive instruments are often shared. A research proposal for a forest technology project
    included a large array of approaches in the forest sciences. The approaches were dissimilar but

problems and theories of another, manifested in computational neuroscience and the philosophy
of cognitive science. Individuals may find their original disciplinary methods and theoretical

AFIR team examined sought to develop a model of mechanisms that mediate mental stress
experiences into physiological reactions and eventually coronary heart disease. Previous studies
emphasized correlation of single stress factors or separate personal traits associated with the
disease. In contrast, the project aimed to develop an interdisciplinary theory based on integration
of psychological and medical elements and testing the conceptual tool of inherited
‘temperament’ (Bruun et al. 2005, p.86).

def is_bridge_building():
    """
    The Nuffield Foundation in London identified two basic metaphors of interdisciplinarity -
- bridge building and restructuring. Bridge building occurs between complete and firm
disciplines. Restructuring detaches parts of several disciplines to form a new coherent whole.
The Foundation also noted a third possibility that occurs when a new overarching concept or
theory subsumes theories and concepts of several existing disciplines, akin to the notion of
Transdisciplinarity (Interdisciplinarity 1975, pp.42-45). The difference between Bridge Building
and Restructuring is illustrated by Landau, Proshansky, and Ittelson’s classification of two
phases in the history of interdisciplinary approaches in social sciences. The first phase, dating
from the close of World War I to the 1930s, was embodied in the founding of the Social Science
Research Council and the University of Chicago school of social science. The interactionist
framework at Chicago fostered integration, and members of the Chicago school were active in
efforts to construct a unified philosophy of natural and social sciences. The impacts were widely
felt, and on occasion disciplinary “spillage” led to the formation of hybrid disciplines such as
social psychology and political sociology. However, traditional categories of knowledge and
academic structures remained intact.

def is_instrumental():
    """In an analysis of forms of interdisciplinary explanation, Mark Kann identified three
political positions. Conservative elites want to solve social and economic problems, without
concern for epistemological questions. Liberal academics demand accommodation but maintain
a base in the existing structure. Radical dissidents challenge the existing structure of knowledge,
demanding that interdisciplinarity respond to the needs and problems of oppressed and
marginalized groups (1979, pp.187-88). These conflicting motivations are apparent in the
faultline dividing Instrumental and Critical forms. Methodological ID is “instrumental” in
serving the needs of a discipline. During the 1980s, though, another kind of Instrumental ID
gained visibility in science-based areas of economic competition, such as computers,
biotechnology and biomedicine, manufacturing, and high-technology industries. Peter Weingart
treats this type of activity as Strategic or Opportunistic ID (2000, p.39). In this instance,
Interdisciplinarity serves the market and national needs.
    """
    return

def is_critical():
    """
    In contrast, Critical ID interrogates the dominant structure of knowledge and education
with the aim of transforming them, raising questions of value and purpose silent in Instrumental
ID. New fields in Miller’s Life Experience category were often imbued with a critical imperative,
prompting Douglas Bennett to call them a “sacred edge” in the reopened battle over inclusion
Klein Taxonomy - 16
and exclusion (1997, p.144). Older fields, such as American studies, also took a “critical turn” in
the 1960s and 1970s, and a “new interdisciplinarity” emerged in humanities (Klein 2005, pp.153-
75). Salter and Hearn (1996) call interdisciplinarity the necessary “churn in the system,” aligning
it with a dynamic striving for change that disturbs continuity and routine. This imperative is
signified in a new rhetoric of “anti,” “post.” “non,” and “de-disciplinary” that is prominent in
cultural studies, women’s and ethnic studies, literary studies, and postmodern approaches across
disciplines. An increasing number of faculty in humanities and social sciences, Lattuca reports,
do interdisciplinary work with an explicit intent to deconstruct disciplinary knowledge and
boundaries, blurring the boundaries of the epistemological and the political (2001, pp.15-16,
100)

The disciplines are also implicated in Critical ID. Giles Gunn’s typology of
interdisciplinary approaches to literary studies identifies four approaches to mapping. The
simplest strategy is on disciplinary ground, tracing the relationship of one discipline to another,
such as “literature and …” philosophy or psychology and so forth. The map changes, though, if
another question is asked. What new subjects and topics have emerged? New examples appear,
including the history of the book, psychoanalysis of the reader, and the ideology of gender, race,
and class. Each topic, in turn, projected further lines of investigation. “The threading of
disciplinary principles and procedures,” Gunn found, “is frequently doubled, tripled, and
quadrupled in ways that are not only mixed but, from a conventional disciplinary perspective,
somewhat off center.” They do not develop in linear fashion but are characterized by
overlapping, underlayered, interlaced, crosshatched affiliations, collations, and alliances with illunderstood
and unpredictable feedbacks. The final and most difficult approach to mapping is
rarely acknowledged. Correlate fields and disciplines have changed, challenging assumptions
Klein Taxonomy - 17
about the strength of boundaries while working to erode them. “The inevitable result of much
interdisciplinary study, if not its ostensible purpose,” Gunn concluded, “is to dispute and disorder
conventional understandings of relations between such things as origin and terminus, center and
periphery, focus and margin, inside and outside (1992, pp.241-43, 248-49).
