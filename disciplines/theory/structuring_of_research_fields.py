"""Structuring of research fields.

This module investigates concept used by Vinck in Sociology of Scientific work.
It contains four functions that investigate whether research field can be
considered as having one type of structuring. It looks for four types of 
structuring: polycentric oligarchy, partitioned beurocracy, fragmented adhocracy,
professional adhocracy, polycentric profession, technologically integrated bureocracy 
and conceptually integrated bureaucracy.

Example:
    is_polycentric_oligarhy('philosophy')
    > 0.1
    is_polycentric_oligarhy('sociology')
    > 0.35

Args:
    authors
    data
    concepts
    urls
    reading

Data:
    researcher positions : are they in power
    schools : hard to identify, have to be based on some research
    methods : result assessment methods
    training proggrames : check whether they are standardised
    focus : are they focused on analytical work

    coalition_list : is discipline in coalitions
    research resource coordination : who coordinates.

    working procedures : are they common?
    controversies : what is a framework of their solutions?

    instruments : what instrumentas are used?
    methods : what methods are used?
    empiricity of Knowledge : is knowledge empiric
    specificity of knowledge : is knowledge specific?

    theoretical framework : is it unified?
