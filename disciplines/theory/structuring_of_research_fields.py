"""Structuring of research fields.

This module investigates concept used by Vinck in Sociology of Scientific work.
It contains four functions that investigate whether research field can be
considered as having one type of structuring.


Example:

Attributes:

Vinck. The sociology of scientific work.
Whitley, R. (1974), The Intellectual and Social Organization of the Sciences,
