"""Regimes of Knowledge Production

The dividing up into professional groups, disciplines or fields (fundamental/applied
research) cannot fully explain what is happening today. Authors like Krige and
Pestre (1997) suggest that reasoning should be based on the dynamics of research
spaces. These are termed ‘scientific and technological research regimes’, and take
into account the directions of research and the markets where dissemination of
research products takes place. The authors distinguish between four types:

    Theory:
    The disciplinary regime: experts in scientific politics and social scientists (Gibbons et
al., 1994) spontaneously reason within this framework. Without realising it, they reduce
all research activity to this regime and believe that the sciences are undergoing a major
transformation. In this regime, research programmes are established according to the
criteria of the disciplinary group, based on the quality of the theory, experimental accuracy, 
concordance between theory and experimentation and the predicted value of
the concepts. The results are disseminated within the scientific community via its own
reviews and conferences. The main aim of contact with external organisations is to obtain
resources in order to pursue the research activity; such contact is therefore steered
by the internal needs of the disciplinary group. Disciplinary communities are structured
around stable and easily identifiable organisations such as university programmes,
scientific reviews and laboratories. They generate a considerable amount of written
work, providing access to their results and facilitating their analysis. The disciplinary
regime highlights the inherent value of knowledge and underlines a natural difference
between science and engineering.

    Notes:
    The transitory regime: in this regime researchers oscillate between two criteria
for selecting research themes and two markets for disseminating results: fundamental
research (unversity referral) and the socioeconomic world. They move between one
and the other depending on their needs. Lately, their preferences, in terms of research
content, public and reputation, have focused on long- term, disinterested research and
exchange with their peers. However, some of the research activity and part of the
professional path are defi ned at the outskirts of the discipline’s institutions, either in
relation to other disciplines or to engineering or action (managerial, political, medical
and so on). Researchers move around inside these other fields depending on their needs
with respect to techniques, data, concepts or alliances. Depending on the case, they make
their choices according to the criteria of their initial discipline or to those of their allied
discipline. Similarly, their work is disseminated either in disciplinary academic reviews or
socioeconomic milieux. The transition between these referral agents can take on at least
three forms: (i) a return trip, limited over time: the identity remains rooted in the initial
discipline, in spite of the excursions; (ii) a lasting, but circumscribed transition structured
according to the initial discipline (for example, from physics to engineering); and (iii)
the creation of new specialities attached to the initial discipline: physical chemistry, biophysics,
astro- physics, geo- physics and molecular electronics. To understand the scientifi c
dynamics at work in the transitory regime, study should not be limited to within the
space of the discipline – which continues to be an important referral agent – but should
focus too on the interfaces and displacements effected.

    Theory:
    The utilitarian regime: researchers take on problems arising from economic and
social demand (engineering sciences, medical sciences and management sciences). In this
regime, the population is highly heterogeneous: technicians, practitioners, advisors and
so on. They belong to equally diverse institutions: universities, but also applied research
organisations, companies, technical ministries, consultancies, industrial technology
centres, professional or citizens’ associations. The space in which results are disseminated
is created by patents, professional reviews and the media. The researchers strive to meet
demands and requests linked to concrete end purposes. The identity of people working
inside this regime oscillates between the scientific specialisation and the milieu in which
the person is engaged (industry, social actions and so on). The differences between the
utilitarian regime and the disciplinary regime became less noticeable towards the end of
the twentieth century. This is mainly due to the fact that both regimes often share 
working methods and instruments. Research programmes are sometimes so similar that,
in some sectors, researchers say that they are only a few months ahead of industrialists.
Practices in the utilitarian and disciplinary regimes are often similar, although the
preferred focus of the researchers belonging to these two categories clearly differs over
time.

    Theory:
    The transverse regime: researchers in this regime are above all interested in
metrology and methodology, as well as in the design and development of generic
instruments or protocols. Their work helps to further academic research or contributes
to utilitarian regime activities. They do not belong to a specifi c discipline, but form
‘interstitial communities’. They work on instruments such as ultra- centrifugal machines,
spectroscopes, lasers or, in the social sciences, on content analysis tools, database
management, scientometry and so on. Those involved in quality management, knowledge
management, the development of modelling and simulation tools and ethics applied to
the sciences belong to this regime. Their instruments are based on general instrumental
principles and theories. These are used to form systems (for example, for detection,
measurement, control and management), which are open, flexible and versatile. The
dissemination of their work (instruments and literature) is via a wide range of university,
industrial, technological and administrative milieux and sometimes has universal impact.
The members of this regime work between disciplines and between institutions, even if
they are necessarily attached to a specific organisation. Their identity is built up through
cross- cutting and heterogeneous networks. They infiltrate niches and circulate between
various groups. They avoid being specifi cally associated with one organisation. They
make it possible to connect up scientific, technological and institutional fields that are at
times isolated from each other. They sometimes help to standardise certain practices
across diverse institutions. In this regime, the interstitial community moves through
phases where it is open and phases where it is more discrete, the latter corresponding
to periods in which instruments are conceived far away from the prying eyes and
infl uence of other groups. This regime is transverse for at least three reasons: (i) the
research focuses have multiple origins; (ii) dissemination spaces are diverse; and (iii) the
community is closely related to the other three regimes. It thus reduces cognitive and
methodological fragmentation.
