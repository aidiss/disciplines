	Applied social sciences (e.g. education):'soft-applied'

	Nature of knowledge 

	Cumulative; atomistic (crystalline/tree-like); concerned with universals, quantities, simplification; resulting in discovery/explanation.
	Reiterative; holistic (organic/river-like); concerned with particulars, qualities, complication; resulting in understanding/interpretation.
	Purposive; pragmatic (know-how via hard knowledge); concerned with mastery of physical environment; resulting in products/techniques.
	Functional; ulitarian (know-how via soft knowledge); concerned with enhancement of [semi-] professional practice; resulting in protocols/procedures

	Nature of disciplinary culture

	Competitive, gregarious; politically well-organized; high publication rate; task-oriented.
	Individualistic, pturastic; loosely structured; low publication rate; personoriented.
	Entrepreneurial, cosmopolitan; dominated by professional values; patents substitutable for publications; role oriented.
	Outward-looking; uncertain in status; dominated by intellectual fashions; publication rates reduced by consultances; power-oriented
