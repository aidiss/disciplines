""" This module is an implementation of theories that deal with
academic disciplines and related phenomenons.

The module is structured by the name of theory 

It includes:
emergence of disciplines
interdisciplinary_models
justification_for_interdisciplinarity
power_struggles
regimes_of_knowledge_production
taxonomy_of_interdisciplinarity
structuring_of_research_fields


The description should contain assessment of possible dificulties and
opportunities of developing implementation of each theory.

Notes:
	There are few types of theories.
	Theories are different in the details that they provide.
	Examples, some theories provide discipline names as an example. This is hepfull but not too much.
	Case studies, some theories provide cases on which the theories are build. This makes it easy to reconstruct the claims.

In general, modules in this package are ready to grasp the data, but the data needs to be prepared.

The package is organized in some levels:
	concepts - they appear in text and may be more or less easy to understand.
	theory - in this research theory can be very small or big. Definition of theory may be only it.
	theories, with little exceptions, organize different building blocks that can be found in blocks folder.

	interpretations - these are not straighforward obvious from the theory but can be retrieved.
