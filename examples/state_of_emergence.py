"""State of emergence.

At what stage of emergence services sciences are
First, nodal point in emergence of disciplines.
That case requires us to understand what kind of nodal points can do that.
It is rather straightforward, that we have to have network of citations (networkx?) to build on it
We also may stand on findings of other people, that is to say we can use a referenced statement that 
marks arisal of nodal point.

In case we have data we have to have rules to operate on it. In our case Ziman is not providing us
with any rules. However, by going deeper into search of literature we can find some more spefic descriptions.
In our case works of Lydersdorf fits rather well. Still, we have to agree that we have to do little leap of 
hope or to ground out understanding.

Estimations are important.
